# Exploratory Data Analysis on Diabetes
## by Moshood Sidiq


## Dataset

This dataset consists of inforamtion gathered about diabetes disease from a survey response conducted and gathered by the American centre for disease control (CDC). The dataset can be gotten from the Kaggle dataset collection [from here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset?select=diabetes_binary_5050split_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv). Documentations and explanation on each variable/feach can also be found there as well.


## Summary of Findings

This exploratory process contains three main sections; the univariate, bivariate and multivariate aspects of explorations. From the univariate section, I gathered that the dataset is fairly balanced with almost equal amount of entries that are non-diabetic and (pre)diabetic. Another key finding is that the mean BMI is approximately 30, and it has a lot of outliers which may be depicted as unhealthy BMI values. In the bivariate section, I tried to find out how some key variables are related to each other. It turns out the BMI affects the health status generally. It can also be depicted that age factor also determines the risk of being diabetic, as the risk increase with increasing age. It is important to mention that females have a higher risk of being diabetic, compared to their male counterparts. Lastly in the multivariate section, I tried to find out how lifestyles and demographic factors affects the health and BMI status. Smoking and Heavy drinking increases the risk of having more physical health difficulties, eating fruits and vegetables tends to minimize physical health difficulties and maintain healthy BMI to an extent, and lastly the class of entries having high income and education status tend to have more access to doctors and less tendency to being diabetic in realation better mental and physical health status as compared to the lower classes.

## Key Insights for Presentation

In my presentation, I start by introducing what my investigation is all about and what I aim to achieve from the investigation. I tried to introducing some key variables by plotting their distribution; diabetic status, access to doctors, and sex were the categorical variables visualized, while the distribution of BMI is the continuous variable I vsualized. Then I plotted a clustered bar chart to show the relationship between Diabetic status and High blood pressure, followed by a stacked bar chart in which it was discovered women tend to be more diabetic prone as compared to their male counterparts.

Afterwards I used pointplots to show the relationship between demographic factors, Physical and mental health difficulties with Diabetic status, also separately with access to doctors.
